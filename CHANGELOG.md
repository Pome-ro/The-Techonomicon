* Added script to find and update users in AD with employee numbers from another system. Uses the Email field as a matching condition. Useful for cleaning up a system you can export data from as well. Way to many people telling office workers to put their aliases into systems instead of their primary email. I've had to recreate this script one to many times. Now it shall live on forever in the tattered pages of the Technonomicon. It is committed, and thus it shall be 🤘💀🤘
